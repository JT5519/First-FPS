        BOX SHOOTER
                    by Joel Shaji 

        INSTRUCTIONS: 
        -> Move around using the arrow keys or WASD and look around using the mouse
        -> The mouse sensitivity and inverting of Y axis may be subjective so you 
	   can adjust it in the settings tab in the main menu, according to your 
  	   comfort. 
	-> You need 50 points to beat level1 and you get a starting time of 15 seconds, 
	   shoot the white cubes to increase time, the yellow will decrease time and 
	   the greens give you 10 points each
           
	   
	LEVEL2:

	   Level2 is my own creation and it is what I had in mind when we started week4,
	   I have made it longer and almost impossible to beat so that you can play around,
	   check it out, it is a suprise :D. Incase you feel like beating it, you get 1000
	   seconds to score 1000 points, each "enemy" gets you 10 points. 
		
	   Each enemy has 5 health points which is displayed above their head, you in turn
	   have 20 health points. When you are hit, your player will recoil thus letting you
	   know you are hit, also, your health in the top right corner will decrease. 
		

        SUGGESTIONS: 
 	   -> I found an initial sensitivity settings for both axis at 25% to work best so 
	      those are the defaults I have set, feel free to change them in the settings 
	      tab according to your comfort.
	   -> The enemies in level2 have a pretty basic chase script so dont stay still
	      behind an obstacle perpendicular to their direction of motion, or they wont
	      navigate around obstacles to come get you. Try dodging their 
	      projectiles and then killing them. 

        THANK YOU :D
